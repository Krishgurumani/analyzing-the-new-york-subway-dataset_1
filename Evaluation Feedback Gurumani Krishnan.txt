Dear Grader,
Thanks for the feedback. Here are updates to your evaluation. 
(1) Statistical tests or linear regression models are not described thoroughly, or the reasons for choosing them are not clearly articulated.
Ans: 
I have revised the explanation for R^2 value for Question 2.6 & 4.2. Many thanks for clarifying my understanding & for sending me the links!

(2) In your next submission please make sure that the labels in your Ridership by day-of-week plot are visible from the plot and not inserted after and that the days follow their natural order from Monday to Sunday in the X axis.
Ans: 
In my 1st project submission,  had labeled my plots using ggplot. However the font size comes out to be very small in the Udacity IDE & is not very clear, when pasted in Word.  After many hours of searching for a fontsize or 'theme' style similar to R, I could not change the font size. If you know of the functionality using GGplot, please let me know. 

In my current line of work, I do a lot of presentations & I insert labels post data analysis, so that people sitting far across the room can view it clearly. 

Anyways, I have replaced the plot Fig:3.2 with labels visible from the plot. Problem Set-4 Code has been modified to order the days from Monday-Sunday. 

Regards,
Guru
